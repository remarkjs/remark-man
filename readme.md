[**remark**][remark] plugin to compile Markdown to man pages.

*   [x] Great unicode support
*   [x] Name, section, and description detection
*   [x] Nested block quotes and lists
*   [x] Tables
*   [x] and much more

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark),
see [`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-man
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# ls(1) -- list directory contents

## SYNOPSIS

`ls` \[`-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1`] \[*file* *...*]
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var unified = require('unified')
var markdown = require('remark-parse')
var man = require('remark-man')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(man)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    file.extname = '.1'
    vfile.writeSync(file)
  })
```

Now, running `node example` and `cat example.1` yields:

```roff
.TH "LS" "1" "June 2019" "" ""
.SH "NAME"
\fBls\fR - list directory contents
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.P
\fBls\fR \[lB]\fB-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1\fR\[rB] \[lB]\fIfile\fR \fI...\fR\[rB]
```

Now, that in my opinion isn’t very readable, but that’s roff/groff/troff.  😉

To properly view that man page, use something like this: `man ./example.1`.

### `remark().use(man[, options])`

Plugin to compile Markdown to man pages.

##### `options`

###### `options.name`

Title of the page (`string`, optional).
Is inferred from the main heading (`# hello-world(7)` sets `name` to
`'hello-world'`) or from the file’s name (`hello-world.1.md` sets `name` to
`'hello-world'`).

###### `options.section`

[Section][man-section] of page (`number` or `string`, optional).
Is inferred from the main heading (`# hello-world(7)` sets `section` to `7`) or
from the file’s name (`hello-world.1.md` sets `section` to `1`).

###### `options.description`

Description of page (`string`, optional).
Is inferred from the main heading (`# hello-world(7) -- Two common words` sets
`description` to `'Two common words'`).

###### `options.date`

Date of page (`number`, `string`, or `Date`, optional).
Given to `new Date(date)` as `date`, so when `null` or `undefined`, defaults to
the current date.
Dates are centered in the footer line of the displayed page.

###### `options.version`

Version of page (`string`, optional).
Versions are positioned at the left of the footer line of the displayed page
(or at the left on even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-sided
printing is active).

###### `options.manual`

Manual of page (`string`, optional).
Manuals are centered in the header line of the displayed page.

###### `options.commonmark`

Parsing mode (`boolean`, default: `false`).
The default behavior is to prefer the last duplicate definition.
Set to `true` to prefer the first when duplicate definitions are found.

## Security

Use of `remark-man` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast]) or
user content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attacks.
